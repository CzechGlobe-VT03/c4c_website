    "eventTitle": "The current moisture deficit in Slovakia can significantly complicate the situation for farmers and foresters in the spring",
    "eventDesc": "Despite the fact that we have a winter period during which the vegetation is at a standstill, the current drought warns us of possible problems in the spring and summer. Recharge of moisture in the soil and groundwater during the cold half-year is an important factor for the  moisture conditions, especially in the spring. Considering the results of the study for Slovakia, which was published last year, we notice a significant increase in dry months during the spring. Due to the fact that spring drought often recurs, a moisture deficit already in the winter season can currently accumulate a significant worsening of the effects of the spring drought itself.\nWe have already noted similar situation with a moisture deficit in the winter period, which complicated agricultural plans and contributed to the reduction of the harvest, even in the recent past. In those years, after a dry winter, there was a spring, or also the summer drought, which led to a reduced yield of some agricultural crops. The current situation therefore means a warning in the coming weeks that unless the weather situation changes significantly and the trend from previous years continues, farmers will have to prepare for the possible negative impact of drought in the coming months and adapt their work in the fields accordingly. The moisture deficit in the past months can have a negative impact on fruit orchards as well.",

    "eventDesc": "The topic of forest fires is becoming more actual, due to the increasingly intense and longer episodes of drought in the recent decades. Last summer again brought with it very warm and dry weather, which created conditions for a high fire risk in Slovakia. Considering the ongoing climate change and climate scenarios for the Central Europe, it is likely that we will face such situations more and more frequently in the future. The Slovak Hydrometeorological Institute SHMI) is also trying to contribute to early preparedness for extreme phenomena, which was the main motivation to join the international project Clim4Cast (Interreg CE). One of the project outputs will be a document focused on a proactive response approach to drought, heat waves and fire danger at the national level. This document will be available to all national, regional and local authorities and can serve as supporting material for the drafting of policies, decrees and other strategic documents. To ensure country-specific tailored document proposal, SHMI organized an expert consultation dedicated to the wildfires management in Slovakia, in which representatives of key stakeholders participated. This consultation was followed by a meeting of experts from the practice of the National Drought Impact Reporting Network in Ka\u0161tiela Antonst\u00e1l in Nem\u0161ov\u00e1 (October 23 and 24, 2024).\nTo learn more about the event, please, visit the webpage: https://www.shmu.sk/sk/?page=2049&id=1548.

This event was crucial in introducing the project to relevant institutions and experts in Croatia.\n\nThe event was divided into two parts. The first part provided an overview of the project, outlining both completed and planned activities. Notably, a valuable database of drought, heatwaves, and fire weather (DHF) events was developed by collecting data from daily newspaper Ve\u010dernji list articles spanning the years 2000 to 2023.\n\nThe second part of the event served as a platform for discussion, where participants emphasized the importance of inter-institutional collaboration in strengthening societal resilience to DHF events.\n\nThe full article is available online (pages 56-59): https://vode.eindigo.net/casopis-hrvatska-vodoprivreda/?pr=v.pdf&id=38665",

September rains, however, have arrived too late, prompting Vukovarsko-srijemska County to join Viroviti\u010dko-podravska  and Koprivni\u010dko-kri\u017eeva\u010dka counties in declaring a natural disaster due to severe drought. Reports of widespread damage stretch from the far east of Slavonia to northern Croatia along the Drava River, affecting the northern Croatian Pannonian Basin.\n\nIn Po\u017ee\u0161ko-slavonska County, residents are facing drought conditions comparable to those of 2003, with the Orljava River's streamflow critically low and many springs completely dry. Water usage has been restricted to essential needs, and irrigation systems are operating at minimum capacity to keep crops alive. Birds and rodents are damaging irrigation pipes in search of water, leading to leaks and further inefficiencies.\n\nZadarska County has reported a 26% increase in heatwave-related deaths and a rise in healthcare interventions. In Viroviti\u010dko-podravska  County, heat-scorched trees are prematurely shedding leaves, and pest populations are growing. Meanwhile, new drone-based tree-planting technology, 3 to 5 times faster than traditional methods and suitable for hazardous terrain, is being used in Slavonija and is planned for coastal regions.\n\nImage: https://meteo.hr/klima_e.php?section=klima_pracenje&param=spi&el=prspi\n",

In the coming days, the area will be intensively checked for embers, including with thermal imaging cameras. Firefighting efforts will continue, with firefighting planes and helicopters on standby. The focus will be on extinguishing remaining fires, with around 50 personnel. The adjacent moorland caused concern for the emergency services. A fire had spread there, although efforts were made to prevent the flames from reaching a high moor.\nAccording to local authorities it is possible that the fire on the Brocken was deliberately set. The fire broke out simultaneously in several places on Friday 6th September according to video footage. The police have initiated an investigation on the cause of the fires. Information on the cause will only be possible once investigators can examine the fire site.\n\n",

Both products very well operationally mapped the situation on the territory of Slovakia.\nTwo products were tested to monitor fire danger - fuel moisture (DFM10H) and Fire Weather Index (FWI). The testing of these tools takes place thanks to intensive cooperation with the Forests of the Slovak Republic, state enterprise, directly in the field through expert assessment by foresters.
