# Clim4Cast Digital Toolbox

Clim4Cast Digital Toolbox designed to support national and regional early warning systems for droughts, heatwaves, and wildfires (DHF). It includes software source code, map visualization scripts, and a web interface. These tools enable multi-temporal forecasting and monitoring across seven Central European countries. The toolbox supports both national implementation and centralized use via the Clim4Cast platform and provides partners with customizable and accessible products in open and visual formats.

This repository has three main folders that include the main components of the digital toolbox.
